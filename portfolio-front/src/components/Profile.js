                    Recently, a mentor recommended the Gallups StrengthsFinder
                    quiz to learn more about applying my strengths. Several of
                    these strengths are related to adaptability and learning.
            <br /><br />
            As an example of adaptability, while working at F’real Foods,
            I dealt with internal and external customers providing technical
            solutions. I had to prioritize and schedule which tasks were most
            critical on a day by day basis. More recently, while participating
            in a group project for the UMKC certificate program, I set aside
            my project suggestion to lead the project that the group agreed on.
            <br /><br />
            As a life long learner I seek out ways to constantly grow in new
            areas. At a previous company, I was able to take the initiative
            and explored the implementation and methods of embedded software.
            Continuing this interest, I am now working with freeRTOS on an
            Arduino board to learn more about these concepts. Additionally,
            I have been developing web applications through the UMKC
            certificate program using Mongo, Express, Angular and Node.
            Using this experience, I have built a full stack website! Both
            of these projects represent different programming paradigms and
            interests which I’m looking forward to applying in a professional
            environment.
